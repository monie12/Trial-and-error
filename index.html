    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I‚Äôm a passionate and dedicated professional with a diverse background in education, sales, and marketing. I hold a
    Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Science from the University of Embu, and I‚Äôm also a certied black belt through the '1
    Million Teachers' program, which has helped me develop leadership, discipline, and focus‚Äîskills I apply in my
    teaching career. I‚Äôve taught biochemistry at schools like Anestar High School and Consolata Girls‚Äô High School, where
    I‚Äôve had the opportunity to create engaging lesson plans, manage classrooms, and build meaningful relationships
    with students, parents, and colleagues. My goal is always to create a supportive, interactive learning environment
    that encourages growth for each individual.<br>
    Alongside my teaching experience, I‚Äôve worked in sales and marketing at 4G Capital, where I honed my skills in
    developing marketing strategies, executing sales activities, and hitting targets. I‚Äôve also learned web development,
    including CSS and HTML, which has given me a fresh, creative outlet for problem-solving and building things from
    scratch. I‚Äôm adaptable, goal-driven, and thrive in environments where I can bring both creativity and strategy to the
    table</p>
    <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <h4>Secondary school teacher</h4>
    <p><em><b>Anestar high school</b></em> [ 04/03/2025 ‚Äì Current ]<br>
    <strong>City:</strong> Nakuru |<strong>Country:</strong> Kenya. <br><br>
    I apply my skills in biochemistry education while integrating modern teaching techniques, including the use of digital
    tools. In addition to developing and delivering lesson plans, I incorporate elements of web development, using my
    knowledge of CSS and HTML to create digital learning resources that enhance the student experience. This includes
    designing interactive educational content, building simple websites or pages for assignments, and oering students
    online resources that complement the traditional classroom setting.<br>
    I also strive to make biochemistry more engaging by incorporating multimedia elements into lessons, such as videos,
    interactive diagrams, and virtual experiments, which I create or customize using my web development skills. This
    approach helps students visualize complex scientic concepts, making them easier to understand and apply.
    In the classroom, I focus on creating an environment where students feel supported, motivated, and encouraged to
    collaborate. I manage classroom behavior and encourage active participation by fostering a positive atmosphere
    where every student‚Äôs input is valued. By incorporating technology, I‚Äôm able to create an interactive learning space
    that extends beyond the classroom, helping students to not only succeed academically but also develop digital
    literacy skills that will serve them in the future.</p>

    At Consolata Girls‚Äô High School, I was deeply involved in both the academic and emotional growth of my students. My

    diverse learning styles, using a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and visual aids to make complex concepts more
    understandable.<br>
    In addition to teaching, I took on the responsibility of managing classroom behavior, creating a structured
    environment where students could focus and actively participate in learning. I used a range of strategies to maintain
    discipline, but also encouraged an atmosphere of mutual respect, allowing students to feel comfortable expressing
    themselves and asking questions.<br>
    I worked closely with both students and their parents, regularly checking in on academic progress and addressing
    any concerns. I believe in open communication, so I ensured that parents were kept informed about their children‚Äôs
    development. This helped me to create a strong support system that extended beyond the classroom.<br>
    I also made it a priority to identify the individual needs of each student. By closely observing their strengths and
    challenges, I collaborated with my colleagues to oer targeted support and interventions when necessary. My goal
    was always to ensure that each student felt valued and was given the tools they needed to succeed in their studies
